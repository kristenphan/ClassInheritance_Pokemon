__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
Modify the Grass_Pokemon subclass so that the attack strength for Grass_Pokemon instances does not change until they reach level 10. At level 10 and up, their attack strength should increase by the attack_boost amount when they are trained.

To test, create an instance of the class with the name as "Bulby". Assign the instance to the variable p2. Create another instance of the Grass_Pokemon class with the name set to "Pika" and assign that instance to the variable p3. Then, use Grass_Pokemon methods to train the p3 Grass_Pokemon instance until it reaches at least level 10.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and wonâ€™t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
